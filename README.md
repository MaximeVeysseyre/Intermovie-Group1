# Intermovie Project - Group 1

## Introduction

The project aims to carry out four queries on a dataset related to the world of cinema.
Requests will be made through a NoteBook.


## Prerequisites

A computer.
An IDE capable of reading NoteBook files written in python (.ipynb file).


## Installation

To function, the NoteBook will need the following tree structure (You must create and integrate the folders as indicated below):

- A "data" folder and a "src" folder at the root of the project (At the same tree level as the "main.ipynb" file).

- The "data" folder must contain the following three folders: "CURATED", "RAW" and "REQUESTS".

- The "RAW" folder must contain the basic datasets after their extraction (.tsv files).

- The "src" folder contains our utility modules: "credentials.py" and "split_datas.py".

- The "REQUESTS" folder will contain the CSV files where the requests will be stored when they are executed.

- The "CURATED" folder will contain the sorted CSV files after using the "split_datas" function within the "main.ipynb" NoteBook.


## Start-up

To start the project, you will then just have to open the "main.ipynb" file and launch the cells in order, if you see the paths of the created folders and files appear, everything is working correctly, otherwise, repeat the "Installation" part of this Readme (see above).
